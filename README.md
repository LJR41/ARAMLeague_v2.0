# Welcome to the ARAM League

My friends and I have been playing the popular MOBA League of Legends for over a decade. Even now in our early 30's we find time to play alongside each other, but we want to keep our competitive edge.
Enter the ARAM League, a web-app I built to track our stats in a 'fantasy-football-league' type of way. The short of it is, we play ARAM(All Random All Mid) and whomever deals the most damage in the game wins
a small amount of coin from the other players! There are caveats, such as if our team wins or losses, if they bounty was hit, or the winner is On Fire. 

At the beginning of this 2nd season of our ARAM League (the first season ending with a players wedding and proceeds going to the festivities), I took it upon myself to become League Commissioner and take our League
into the next era with a well developed and intricate web-app to keep track of our statistics. Last season was done over an Excel sheet and was a debaucle settling up the weekend of the wedding. With our newly developed ARAM League app
we're able to easily see and quantify the leaders in the League with a simple few clicks.

## How it Works

The bread and butter of this app is how the relationships between users, matches, money earned and lost all work with each other. Creating a match, recording the data and selecting the users is the easy 3 step process to add data to the back-end. The front-end is loaded to handle most of the unique situations that can occur in our league on any given match. This data is then stored on a local server, then called again to the front-end where most of the heavy lifting is done to display the data in an efficient and easy way for all players to understand.
